#WDI-Project-1

Welcome to **"Alien Attack"** web application game. First project for *WDI-LONDON*


##Introduction
**"Alien Attack"** is a one player shooting game based on the famous **Duck-Hunt** game. **Duck-Hunt** first released in Japan on April 21, 1984. I recreated this game for my first project on the Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly using JavaScript. A hosted version of Salvy McMeme Face can be found [here] (https://salvy.herokuapp.com) The code can be viewed [here] (https://github.com/BRHGreen/wdi-project-1)
